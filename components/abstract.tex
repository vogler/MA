The thesis starts by introducing some basic concepts of program analysis and an overview of the program analyzer Goblint, which is written in OCaml and developed at the chair. Goblint is a static analyzer for multi-threaded C programs and is mainly used for data race detection.

The main part describes the development of a specification language which can be used to verify regular safety properties of C programs. The work is based on Goblint as a framework for the analyses. Verification of file handle usage serves as an example for comparing a manual implementation with the developed specification language.

Finally other possible use cases and limitations are explored.
